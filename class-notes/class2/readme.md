## Agenda

1. Lecture: Full Stack Development
2. Tutorial: Setting Up File Structure

## Full Stack Development

![internet](../../images/client-server.png)

is when we use JavaScript as both

```
Full Stack Development = front-end (client) + back-end (server)
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Client | Server | 
|---|---|
| any computer / software that requests access to a service | provides resources to the client

### Client

- HTML
  - *H*yper*t*ext *M*arkup *L*anguage - structure
- CSS
  - *C*ascading *S*tyle *S*heets - visual look of a page
- JavaScript (Client-side)
  - "Web Browser Programming Language" - interactions handled by `<script>` tag (we will work with this starting project 2)

### Server

- JavaScript (Server-side)
  - Node.js - "runtime environment" (ie. engine) to run JS as a standalone application
  - Express.js - a Node.js "framework" to create web applications

## Tutorial: Setting Up File Structure

1. Make your github account if you do not have one already
2. Fork the [starter repo](https://github.com/samheckle/networked-media-starter)
3. Rename to `networked-media` + create
4. Download the zip file (Green Code Button -> Download Zip)
5. Determine where your folder will exist for the rest of the semester (remember my folder structure of `Users/samheckle/dev/`). _This will be the folder that you will use for the rest of the semester!_
6. Open your folder in your text editor
7. Every class, you will follow along with the class demos and put it in the demos folder. Every project, you will work inside the correct folder.
8. Make a `class2` folder inside `/class-demos/`

Other file structure notes:

- you can name files whatever, but they should _never_ have spaces (this includes folders, filenames, assets, etc)
- to view your `.html` code, you need to drag your file into your browser. this will display a url path that will look something like `file://Users/samheckle/dev/networked-media/week1/index.html`. **this is not a public link and is not accessible beyond your computer**.

## Continue HTML Tutorial

After we setup our file structure, lets go back to our [HTML notes](../class1/readme.md#introduction-to-html)
